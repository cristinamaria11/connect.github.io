# The problem

The problem nowadays with jobs is coming both from the employer and the employees. The employers have way too much candidates to choose from and the possible employees are contacted from a lot of companies which are often not suitable for them and get tired of all this process. In a few words, the problem with the hiring process consists of the complexity of it.

# The solution

Our project comes with a solution for the problem mentioned above.  
***Connect*** is a web application which is based on the match between employers and employees. Both of them can see the other's profile and swipe right if they like what they see. Only if there is a match, the employment process can continue and if not, contact can not be made. Following these rules, the amount of candidates is smaller and, in the same time, the candidates are not approached by so many recruiters.

# Customer segment

***Connect*** is meant to target a pretty large market, being meant to fulfill the needs for almost everyone who has some knowledge regarding a specific subject.  

This application should be suitable for:
* **employers** all around the world looking for people to fill their open positions in the company
* **candidates** who want to start building their career or want to make a change in their existing one

# Competition

This market is full of all sorts of applications and websites that are meant to help candidates find a job or recruiters find someone to fill their open positions. Despite of this, the process is still pretty difficult and taskes a lot of time. One of the most popular applications used nowadays are mentioned below:  

<img src="/connect.github.io/images/linkedin.png" alt="Linkedin" width="20" height="20"> ***Linkedin***  
The world's largest professional network with more than 645+ million users in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide. LinkedIn leads a diversified business with revenues from membership subscriptions, advertising sales and recruitment solutions. Altough this network seems to be pretty professional, a lot of people started using it because of its popularity and even if you can still find relevant information there, it is also a lot of irrelevant information that just complicates it all.  

<img src="/connect.github.io/images/glassdoor.png" alt="Glassdoor" width="20" height="20"> ***Glassdoor***  
Glassdoor is one of the world’s largest job and recruiting sites. Built on the foundation of increasing workplace transparency, Glassdoor offers millions of the latest job listings, combined with a growing database of company reviews, CEO approval ratings, salary reports, interview reviews and questions, benefits reviews, office photos and more. Unlike other job sites, all of this information is shared by those who know a company best — the employees. This website is a more professional one compared to Linkedin, but it is also a lot more complex and more hard to use.

**Number of new customers/Growth:** In order for customer to switch to our service, we need to provide at least one thing better than any products on the same market. We want to help people find a job faster than any other service. First of all, we have to tell people about our platform and make them register and create a job profile. We expect at least 30 candidate accounts and 5 companies registered in the first 3 months.

**Daily Active Users:** The platform aims to help users track more job offers so they can find a place as quickly as possible. We expect users to spend about 3 hours a day.
