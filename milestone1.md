# The problem

The problem nowadays with jobs is coming both from the employer and the employees. The employers have way too much candidates to choose from and the possible employees are contacted from a lot of companies which are often not suitable for them and get tired of all this process. In a few words, the problem with the hiring process consists of the complexity of it.

# The solution

Our project comes with a solution for the problem mentioned above.  
***Connect*** is a web application which is based on the match between employers and employees. Both of them can see the other's profile and swipe right if they like what they see. Only if there is a match, the employment process can continue and if not, contact can not be made. Following these rules, the amount of candidates is smaller and, in the same time, the candidates are not approached by so many recruiters.

# Customer segment

***Connect*** is meant to target a pretty large market, being meant to fulfill the needs for almost everyone who has some knowledge regarding a specific subject.  

This application should be suitable for:
* **employers** all around the world looking for people to fill their open positions in the company
* **candidates** who want to start building their career or want to make a change in their existing one

# Competition

This market is full of all sorts of applications and websites that are meant to help candidates find a job or recruiters find someone to fill their open positions. Despite of this, the process is still pretty difficult and taskes a lot of time. One of the most popular applications used nowadays are mentioned below:
