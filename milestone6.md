# Target market
Any good business has a target market well defined. Saying that a business targets anyone who is interested is too general and brings no benefits. 
Usually, the target market can be identified by looking at the one other similar products are targeting, but this is not always the best idea as they may overlook a niche market.  
Our product is targeting 2 big markets, those being, on the one side, any company that looks to improve their hiring process and is opened to use a new method to do it and, on the other side, the people that are looking for changing their job.  
Firstly, our main interest regarding companies are the bigger ones as they would use an app like ours more intense and, because they get into contact with a lot more people, we could get known faster.  
Secondly, due to the fact that people that are younger tend to be more interested in trying new things, we mainly target students or graduates, but this does not mean that we have no interest in older people using our application.

## Linkedin

As well as individual professionals, LinkedIn allows businesses to create profiles, and list current vacancies. Members can apply for these positions directly through LinkedIn’s interface. LinkedIn also provides a publishing platform, designed to facilitate thought leadership in the business world.  

LinkedIn reports over 660 million users spread over 200 countries, as of late November 2019. Between them, they represent 30 million companies. The active user base of LinkedIn is debated. Using SimilarWeb data, We Are Social and Hootsuite in October 2019 estimate LinkedIn MAUs at 310 million (47% of members). This is relatively consistent with Boston-based Apptopia’s 2017 estimate of an active LinkedIn user base of around 250 million in 2017, representing 50% of its 500 million members at the time.
 
## Indeed

Indeed is the number 1 job site in the world1 with over 250 million unique visitors2 every month. Indeed strives to put job seekers first, giving them free access to search for jobs, post resumes, and research companies. Every day, they connect millions of people to new opportunities.  

The site aggregates job listings from thousands of websites, including job boards, staffing firms, associations, and company career pages. They generate revenue by selling premium job posting and resume features to employers and companies hiring. In 2011, Indeed began allowing job seekers to apply directly to jobs on Indeed's site and offering resume posting and storage.  

Indeed.com earns a profit using a pay-per-click model. That means employers posting jobs pay a small fee each time a job seeker views a posting. Most clicks on Indeed.com cost between $0.25 - $1.50. The site also earns revenue through traditional website advertising.

# Potential market share in first 5 years
To determinate the market share of the competition we use as reference the number of active users in a month. The total number of users is indicative, as some of them can use multiple platforms in parallel.

These are the statistics for the biggest competitors:

</table>

We estimate that the total number of active users will increase by 15 million every year, according to user growth of the main competitor, Linkedin.

In the first year, we are looking forward to get 0.2% of the current market share. The next year, through good feedback and numerous ads, we aim to get on our platform another 1% of active users. Following years, we estimate a exponential growth.
