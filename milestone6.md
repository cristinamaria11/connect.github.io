# Target market
Any good business has a target market well defined. Saying that a business targets anyone who is interested is too general and brings no benefits. 
Usually, the target market can be identified by looking at the one other similar products are targeting, but this is not always the best idea as they may overlook a niche market.  
Our product is targeting 2 big markets, those being, on the one side, any company that looks to improve their hiring process and is opened to use a new method to do it and, on the other side, the people that are looking for changing their job.  
Firstly, our main interest regarding companies are the bigger ones as they would use an app like ours more intense and, because they get into contact with a lot more people, we could get known faster.  
Secondly, due to the fact that people that are younger tend to be more interested in trying new things, we mainly target students or graduates, but this does not mean that we have no interest in older people using our application.

## Linkedin 
<img src="/connect.github.io/images/market/linkedin-logo.png" alt="Linkedin" width="200" height="80">

As well as individual professionals, LinkedIn allows businesses to create profiles, and list current vacancies. Members can apply for these positions directly through LinkedIn’s interface. LinkedIn also provides a publishing platform, designed to facilitate thought leadership in the business world.  

LinkedIn reports over 660 million users spread over 200 countries, as of late November 2019. Between them, they represent 30 million companies. The active user base of LinkedIn is debated. Using SimilarWeb data, We Are Social and Hootsuite in October 2019 estimate LinkedIn MAUs at 310 million (47% of members). This is relatively consistent with Boston-based Apptopia’s 2017 estimate of an active LinkedIn user base of around 250 million in 2017, representing 50% of its 500 million members at the time.
 
## Indeed

# Potential market share in first 5 years

To determinate the market share of the competition we use as reference the number of active users in a month. The total number of users is indicative, as some of them can use multiple platforms in parallel.

These are the statistics for the biggest competitors:

We estimate that the total number of active users will increase by approximately 10 million every year, according to user growth of the main competitor, Linkedin.

In the first year, we are looking forward to get 0.1% of the current market share. The next year, through good feedback and numerous ads, we aim to get on our platform another 0.5% of active users. Following years, we estimate a exponential growth.

# Market value in first 5 years

Recruitment platform have mainly 3 sources of revenue:
* **Recruiter profile** - is used primarily by corporate recruiting teams to find candidates for jobs
* **Marketing solution** - this is revenue from display ads
* **Premium subscriptions** - you have some advantages over a regular user

Being our biggest competitor, we analyzed LinkedIn's revenues. The Recruiter Corporate package costs just over **$8,600 annually** (if you pay upfront; it’s about **$10,800 each year** if you pay month-to-month). LinkedIn makes about **$90 million each quarter**, or about 23% of total revenue, from showing ads to its users. These ads appear on most pages on the site, and include both IAB standard ads (such as a 300×250 rectangle) as well as custom text ads. LinkedIn offers its members four tiers of membership on the site, including a free option. The other three range from about **$20 / month up to $75 / month**, depending on the features desired.

In our case, the main source of income will be from Recruiter profiles and Premium subscriptions, because we can't generate such big pageviews for receiving enough income from ads. Therefore, we will aproximate a revenue of **50 EUR per month for the Recruiter Corporate package**. Considering a number of 50 companies after first year, that means **2500 EUR monthly**. For premium members, we will set a **2 EUR to 5 EUR per month subscription**. If we assume that 1% of the users will buy that subscription, this mean **12000 EUR monthly** after first year (for 0.6 million users).
