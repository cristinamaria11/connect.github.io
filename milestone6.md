# Target market
Any good business has a target market well defined. Saying that a business targets anyone who is interested is too general and brings no benefits. 
Usually, the target market can be identified by looking at the one other similar products are targeting, but this is not always the best idea as they may overlook a niche market.  
Our product is targeting 2 big markets, those being, on the one side, any company that looks to improve their hiring process and is opened to use a new method to do it and, on the other side, the people that are looking for changing their job.  
Firstly, our main interest regarding companies are the bigger ones as they would use an app like ours more intense and, because they get into contact with a lot more people, we could get known faster.  
Secondly, due to the fact that people that are younger tend to be more interested in trying new things, we mainly target students or graduates, but this does not mean that we have no interest in older people using our application.

As well as individual professionals, LinkedIn allows businesses to create profiles, and list current vacancies. Members can apply for these positions directly through LinkedIn’s interface. LinkedIn also provides a publishing platform, designed to facilitate thought leadership in the business world.  

LinkedIn reports over 660 million users spread over 200 countries, as of late November 2019. Between them, they represent 30 million companies. The active user base of LinkedIn is debated. Using SimilarWeb data, We Are Social and Hootsuite in October 2019 estimate LinkedIn MAUs at 310 million (47% of members). This is relatively consistent with Boston-based Apptopia’s 2017 estimate of an active LinkedIn user base of around 250 million in 2017, representing 50% of its 500 million members at the time.
