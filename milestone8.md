# Alpha testing

We, Connect team, find mandatory to go through every possible combination of steps that could have been made in our product to make sure that we did not forget some of the essential features that we would like to implement.

After testing the Connect application, we indeed found things that we wanted to adjust. For instance, after importing the LinkedIn profile information, some of the data was not correctly added to the Connect profile. For this matter, we restructured the profile details so that the LinkedIn basic information will match what we wanted to have in Connect.

Even though we constantly made some small changes about the user interface, we agreed on moving forward to the next phase of testing, Beta Testing, by contacting the people that subscribed for newsletter on our website.


# Beta testing & Testimonials

What better way to test the MVP presented in the previous milestone than giving it to people to use it? This is how we decided to go about this milestone. Even if the product is not ready, the feedback is welcome anytime, especially from people that really get to see the product and use it.

Below we have a few testimonials from both types of users that we are intending to sell our application to, those being HR employees or people being in search of a new job.

## Accounting graduate  
It is great to see such an easy to use application for a process that usually takes me a lot of time to figure it out.   
Yes, I am definitely willing to pay for this application as long as it keeps the price I was informed about. My opinion is that it really takes into consideration the fact that most probably the people that will use it, the people that are searching now for jobs are, most of them, fresh graduates that don't have a lot of money.   
Another aspect that I really appreciate about this product is the fact that you can use the regular version and, only when you're happy with the results of the application, you can pay for the premium version that offers you some more features.

## Andrada Cordescu, 23, Computer science student
I really like this app. As i understand, some of both the basic and the premium features are available now for the first couple of users. The best things about this product are that i can go back to the jobs i swiped left and that i can see who liked my profile.   
At this point you got me, if I didn’t had the chance to be in the first clients to use the app to get the premium features for free, I would totally had paid for the subscription. Another thing that I liked about the product is the interface, because it is very user friendly and it is much easier to complete your profile than on other platforms. I like that the companies that want your skills will appear first in your match. One suggestion, for the so much wanted release of the app, is to add a save button in order to go back to the ad if you do not want to apply directly.

## Recruiter
As a HR recruiter in a big corporation, it is important to find the perfect candidate for the open positions. I often find myself searching for a long period on LinkedIn for an exact match of the other person’s abilities and interests with the ones I am interested in.   
Luckily, I found Connect or maybe I can say that Connect found me :D. My honest opinion is that it is very easy to work with and all I need to do is to add the job description and some key points I want to see in the candidate’s profile. Despite finding some profiles that I will actually contact, the main thing I suggest improving is the diversity because at some point, there were not any new candidates and I kept seeing the same repeatedly.   
Overall, I am interested in using Connect and match with couple of new candidates over there.   
As long as my willingness to pay for this product goes, at the moment, at least from what I saw so far I am inclined to buy the product myself.   
Regarding the companies, I find the idea of paying per number of job posts really interesting. The fact that both smaller and bigger companies are meant to use the product should influence somehow the price that those companies are paying because you can't really expect a company with 50 employees to afford to pay as more as a company with 500. I find this marketing strategy really good and I really think it will help with the sale of the product once it is up and running.
