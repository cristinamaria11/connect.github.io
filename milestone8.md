# First Sale

What better way to test the MVP presented in the previous milestone than giving it to people to use it? This is how we decided to go about this milestone. Even if the product is not ready, the feedback is welcome anytime, especially from people that really get to see the product and use it.

Below we have a few testimonials from friends that tested our app and also suggested some changes:

# Alpha testing

We, Connect team, find mandatory to go through every possible combination of steps that could have been made in our product to make sure that we did not forget some of the essential features that we would like to implement.

After testing the Connect application, we indeed found things that we wanted to adjust. For instance, after importing the LinkedIn profile information, some of the data was not correctly added to the Connect profile. For this matter, we restructured the profile details so that the LinkedIn basic information will match what we wanted to have in Connect.

Even though we constantly made some small changes about the user interface, we agreed on moving forward to the next phase of testing, Beta Testing, by contacting the people that subscribed for newsletter on our website.


# Beta testing & Testimonials

## Liliana Calinescu, 22, Accounting student
It is a great application and easy to use but needs more improvement on the way the matches are made. After a couple of swipes where I found some interesting job opportunities, I found myself encountering some job descriptions that were suggested randomly and I was not interested at all (most of them in the IT domain). Another thing that I would like is a notification system that alerts me when new jobs that I am compatible with appears.

## Andrada Cordescu, 23, Computer science student
I really liked this app. The interface is very user friendly and it is much easier to complete your profile than on other platforms. Another thing I like about it is the fact that the companies that want your skills will appear first in your match. One suggestion will be to add a save button in order to go back to the ad if you do not want to apply directly.

## Georgiana Paise, 32, Recruiter at Lenovo
As a HR recruiter in a big corporation, it is important to find the perfect candidate for the open positions. I often find myself searching for a long period on LinkedIn for an exact match of the other person’s abilities and interests with the ones I am interested in. Luckily, I found Connect or maybe I can say that Connect found me :D. It is very easy to work with and all I need to do is to add the job description and some key points I want to see in the candidate’s profile. Despite finding some profiles that I will actually contact, the main thing I suggest improving is the diversity because at some point, there were not any new candidates and I kept seeing the same repeatedly. Overall, I am interested in using Connect and match with couple of new candidates over there.
