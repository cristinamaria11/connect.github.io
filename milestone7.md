We decided to implement some basic features of the application such as the login/signup and the pages of the users, the main functionalities that add the initial value to the project. If a profile is created at the moment, the algorithm that is supposed to recommend the profiles is not in place yet, but a possible buyer can see how the app is supposed to be working.


# Login
The login page is basic, it requires you to complete the username and passwords, just like any other similar page. It also displays some error messages, depending on the case. The motivation behind implementing this functionality is obvious, you can't say an app is any good without having any kind of security, no matter how basic this is at first.

# Creating a profile
After logging in to the application, a user has to choose whether he/she is looking for a job or for a possible employee. This is shown in the following screenshot. The app being meant for 2 different types of users, without this implementation, the app wouldn't make too much sense.

As an employee, the way you can create your account is shown below. Basically, you only need to complete your personal information and upload your CV or link your Linkedin account.
