# Face-to-face interviews   
We chose to interview a few possible users for this part. We talked with some candidates that are currently looking for making a change in their career or that already did this change. We decided to talk mostly with them and not with recruiters because we think they would represent our main targeted customer segment. We also talked with a recruiter because despite the fact that they are not the main ones that will use our app, they will be a pretty big customer segment.

### Interview with Andreea

:question: Are you currently an employee?   
Yes, actually I am.
   
:question: Is this your first job?   
No, this is my third one. The first one was a part-time internship I did about 3 years ago.

:question: Do you prefer to look for a job online? Why?  
Yes, I think this is the way to go these days just because everything happens online. You can, of course, go to some job fairs, but those are only once in a while organised and by looking online you have the advantage of being able to do it whenever you need to.

:question: Do you consider it annoying to be contacted for jobs that you have no interest in?   
This happens pretty often and most of the times yes, I get annoyed because there are, for example, people that contact me on Linkedin about some jobs that have nothing to do with me at all and I can't understand why would you contact someone that doesn't meet your needs. 

:question: How long do you think the whole process of getting yourself employed should take?  
Well, I don't think I can give a specific number here just because I think it depends a lot on what job you are looking for, on the process  that the company has and other aspects.

:question: Describe a bad experience you have had while looking for a job.   
The fact that I hate the most while applying to new jobs is when one company doesn't give you a feedback despite the fact that they said they will. I mean, they can at least send a predefined mail saying you are not a match. I was finishing my internship and I was looking for a full-time job, I was waiting a response from  2 companies, one of them made me an offer and the other one, the one where I wanted to go more didn't say anything so I emailed them. They said there would be a delay for a maximum of 3 days but that didn't happen. Although I emailed them again, they didn't give me any feedback and instead they didn't answer my emails anymore. This was awful because I wanted to take the first offer but at the same time I would have like more the second one and I didn't want to be in the position to say yes to the first ones and then receive an offer from the other ones.

:question: Describe how a good process of finding a job should look for you.  
Well, first of all, I think that I should be able to apply to a few jobs that I  would like in order to see what is on the market, so to speak. Then, after getting my CV viewed by the HR, establishing when to start with the first step of their process of hiring. This shouldn't take more than a few days, maybe a week maximum. After this, depending on their flow, the response after every step should't  take more than a couple of days and if it's the case, they should notice me about being late for whatever reason.
