# Face-to-face interviews   
We chose to interview a few possible users for this part. We talked with some candidates that are currently looking for making a change in their career or that already did this change. We decided to talk mostly with them and not with recruiters because we think they would represent our main targeted customer segment. We also talked with a recruiter because despite the fact that they are not the main ones that will use our app, they will be a pretty big customer segment.

### Interview with Andreea

:question: Are you currently an employee?   
Yes, actually I am.
   
:question: Is this your first job?   
No, this is my third one. The first one was a part-time internship I did about 3 years ago.

:question: Do you prefer to look for a job online? Why?  
Yes, I think this is the way to go these days just because everything happens online. You can, of course, go to some job fairs, but those are only once in a while organised and by looking online you have the advantage of being able to do it whenever you need to.

:question: Do you consider it annoying to be contacted for jobs that you have no interest in?   
This happens pretty often and most of the times yes, I get annoyed because there are, for example, people that contact me on Linkedin about some jobs that have nothing to do with me at all and I can't understand why would you contact someone that doesn't meet your needs. 

:question: How long do you think the whole process of getting yourself employed should take?  
Well, I don't think I can give a specific number here just because I think it depends a lot on what job you are looking for, on the process  that the company has and other aspects.

:question: Describe a bad experience you have had while looking for a job.   
The fact that I hate the most while applying to new jobs is when one company doesn't give you a feedback despite the fact that they said they will. I mean, they can at least send a predefined mail saying you are not a match. I was finishing my internship and I was looking for a full-time job, I was waiting a response from  2 companies, one of them made me an offer and the other one, the one where I wanted to go more didn't say anything so I emailed them. They said there would be a delay for a maximum of 3 days but that didn't happen. Although I emailed them again, they didn't give me any feedback and instead they didn't answer my emails anymore. This was awful because I wanted to take the first offer but at the same time I would have like more the second one and I didn't want to be in the position to say yes to the first ones and then receive an offer from the other ones.

:question: Describe how a good process of finding a job should look for you.  
Well, first of all, I think that I should be able to apply to a few jobs that I  would like in order to see what is on the market, so to speak. Then, after getting my CV viewed by the HR, establishing when to start with the first step of their process of hiring. This shouldn't take more than a few days, maybe a week maximum. After this, depending on their flow, the response after every step should't  take more than a couple of days and if it's the case, they should notice me about being late for whatever reason.

### Interview with Bogdan

:question: Are you currently an employee?          
Yes I am employed.

:question: Is this your first job?          
No, this is my second job.

:question: Do you prefer to look for a job online? Why?               
It's easier to look for a job online. Aside from the job description, you can find a lot of useful information about the company which is valuable information before commiting to a job there. Also, in my field of activity, computer science, most jobs are listed online, I wouldn't know where else to look for a job.

:question: Do you consider it annoying to be contacted for jobs that you have no interest in?        
Yes, I find this very annoying. I receive many messages on Linkedin for example from recruiters searching for candidates. While I'm happy at my current job, I simply ignore these messages. They are mostly generic and do not suit my interests.

:question: How long do you think the whole process of getting yourself employed should take?         
I believe a complete employment process should take between 2-4 weeks. This includes a phone screen, one or more interviews, getting an offer and signing it. A process longer than this makes me lose my interest and look for a job elsewhere.

:question: Describe a bad experience you have had while looking for a job.         
Last year, I have applied for a summer internship at Bloomberg. I was quicky contacted to do an online test. After the test, I had an interview which went quite decent, but after that, I did not hear from them for a long time. A couple of months later, I received an apology email telling me that the process will take a little longer because the high number of candidates, but in the end I was rejected.

:question: Describe how a good process of finding a job should look for you.          
A good process of finding a job should allow me to quickly filter and find jobs that fit my interests. For this, useful filters would be: required experience, programming languages, technologies. I expect to get in touch with employers willing to offer me an interview and schedule a meeting within two weeks time and to get a response in at most 1-2 weeks after the interview.

### Interview with Gabriel

:question: Are you currently an employee?   
Yes.

:question: Is this your first job?   
No, this is the second one.

:question: Do you prefer to look for a job online? Why?  
Yes, i think it is a much easier way to reach the opportunity that suits you best via online applications.

:question: Do you consider it annoying to be contacted for jobs that you have no interest in?   
I actually am, it is annoying to try to explain the recruiter that even though the position looks interesting it is not interesting for me and if i think this from another perspective it is not only about thinking about a response but for the wasted time.

:question: How long do you think the whole process of getting yourself employed should take?  
One week, maybe two.

:question: Describe a bad experience you have had while looking for a job.  
This wasn’t that bad, but it was interesting how much important the communication is. After a week or so looking for a job i decided that a certain position would be the best choice. The HR interview wasn’t that big of a deal, the technical one it was decent and finally the meeting with the manager i could say it was the cherry on top. After some other technical questions we talked about the project and the team, we dive in the list of my attributions and here comes the surprise. The job I initially applied was no longer available and they wanted to place me on a different position even though the technologies were partially different and the whole idea of the project was not on my wishlist. 

:question: Describe how a good process of finding a job should look for you. 
Clear job description and a short period of time required for the whole process of interviewing.

## Interview with a recruiter
We also talked to a recruiter to better understand the hiring process. Ana is 25 years old, has worked in many companies in HR department and now works as People Analytics Specialist. She told us that it always happens to apply inadequate people who have no experience in the field and are rare chances for them to fill the position. If an intership is opened he is contacted but most of the time the candidate is no longer available. The hiring process may take a different time depending on the job available. If the candidate is a junior, it may take up to a week, but for a senior with more experience, more tests are carried out by managers. There is also the problem when there are no candidates to match the profile on hipo 
or who did not apply on the site and the team must search through the millions of profiles on linkedin and ask people. Usually there are many roles that are available and they must also consider the category of people who want to change their jobs. She also told us that usually people are categorized, in "called for an interview", "rejected" and "pending". There are cases when an experienced candidate is wanted but most of them ask for a lot of money and exceed the budget. During this time, the manager can change his mind and ask for a junior, and the HR team starts scrolling again on the pages because in all this time they lost candidates.  She told us that within the company at HR there is only one account for the whole team so that they do not discuss with the same candidate again and they use desktop application most of the time and a mobile application like tinder for jobs is an attractive idea for her.

# User persona

# User stories
As a candidate, I am looking to find a job which suits me and get rid of the anxiety of new beginnings in a fun way. 
The user should open the Connect App, login, save his personal data/CV and start searching for job ads. All he has to do is 
just a simple swipe right if he likes it. If he change his minds and search for another job, he could easily edit his profile.

As a recruitor, who wants to hire the right person for the job, I post the job offer and analyse the candidates profiles. If the recruitor finds a proper candidate and the candidate has already chosen the job, it's a match and emails will be sent to candidates for the interview.

# Update wireframes
Considering the answers of the posible users, the candidates prefer to spend time searching for jobs they would like. Also a process longer than two weeks makes them lose interest and look for a job elsewhere. According to recruitor answer, we are thinking to add a special feature for them, something like "swipe up", to categorize the candidates as "maybe" if the level of experience is less than what they are searching for.
