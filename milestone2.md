# Identifying the problem

Discussing between us about the hiring process within a company, we have come to the conclusion that everyone has encountered some difficulties throughout this process. One of the problems we identified was that the potential employees are contacted by a lot of companies that are often unsuitable for them and get tired throughout the recruitment process.

On the other hand, after a discussion with a person in the field of human resources within a company, dealing with recruitment, we found out that there is a problem for them as well. There are too many unfit people for a certain position, who get to participate in an interview.

In a few words, the problem is that there is no proper **match** between employers and employees.

# Initial solution

Our project, Connect, wants to come as a solution for the problem mentioned above.

Connect is a web application which is based on the match system between employers and employees. Both of them can see the other’s profile/announcement and swipe right if they are interested in the candidate/position, or swipe left if not. Employees can see job announcements along with a description of the position for which they apply, the necessary skills and other useful information, and employers can see the profile of potential candidates along with their skills, their projects and other useful information. Only if there is a **match**, the employment process can continue and if not, contact can not be made.

Following these rules, the amount of candidates is smaller and, in the same time, the candidates are not approached by so many recruiters.

# The General Plan

Our idea solves the complexity and large time of hiring process by creating an application which is based on the match between employers and employees.

We encountered this problem and noticed that many colleagues have gone through this. So the main audience is represented by students who are quickly looking for a job to gain experience. They want it to be a quick process and to find what fits them in the job listings. To apply for a job requires minimal effort that is also fun and attractive.

Also we want to interview people from human resources department to make sure we test all aspects of our market and get a better understanding of our potential clients.

# Customer Validation

In order to test our hypotheses, we start asking people who we believe could be potential customers. For Connect, this means reaching out to students from university and people from human resources department to make sure we test all aspects of our market and get a better understanding of our potential clients.

**Evaluate customer feedback:**

# Conclusion
Considering the results of the questionnaire, the most common problem among candidates is the duration until they receive a response from the employer. Also, another problem that arises is finding the right job ad so that it is fast and easy. We noticed that many prefer to use the official website of the company when they want to apply what is delaying the process, given that they have observed the announcement on another platform. Because of this, we are thinking of giving users the confidence to use a single platform, because the employer also uses the application for the selection of candidates with whom he matches. Connect will be easy to use and will attract the user to spend as much time as possible through the swipe method so he just simply choose what he likes. We believe that once the customers’ responses match your hypothesis, we can go further and come up with a solution for this.
